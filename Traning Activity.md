Getting Started - What is Git?
**What is Git?**
  *So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.*

* Error: Unable to list workspaces for Watson Assistant: Forbidden: Access is denied due to invalid credentials.

  > This error occurs with `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button. Configure a runtime environment variable for `ASSISTANT_APIKEY` to allow automatic configuration of the default skill or configure `SKILL_ID` to use another skill.

* Fail: An operation for service instance wbc-discovery-service is in progress.

  > This error occurs when starting the app before the service is ready. It is currently common behavior with the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button. In this case, click the `Run` button to restart the application. It will succeed when the service is ready.

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery environment is fully created. Wait a few minutes and click the `Run` button to restart the application.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment using the default configuration.
